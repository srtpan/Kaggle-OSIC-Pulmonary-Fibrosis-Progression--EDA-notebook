# Kaggle-s-OSIC-Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Progression--EDA-notebook
This is the notebook for performing the EDA for tabular data of the Pulmonary fibrosis progression competition hosted on Kaggle.

# Problem statement
In this competition, you’ll predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. You’ll determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.
