# Kaggle-s-OSIC-Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Progression--EDA-notebook
This is the notebook for performing the EDA for tabular data of the Pulmonary fibrosis progression competition hosted on Kaggle.

Current methods make fibrotic lung diseases difficult to treat, even with access to a chest CT scan. In addition, the wide range of varied prognoses creates issues in organizing clinical trials. Finally, patients suffer extreme anxiety—in addition to fibrosis-related symptoms—from the disease’s opaque path of progression.

If successful, patients and their families would better understand their prognosis when they are first diagnosed with this incurable lung disease. Improved severity detection would also positively impact treatment trial design and accelerate the clinical development of novel treatments.

# Problem statement
In the competition, the challenge was to predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. You’ll determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.
